# RedirectHunter

RedirectHunter is a security-focused command-line tool that discovers and traces full redirect chains. It follows server-side HTTP 3xx, HTML meta refreshes, and JavaScript redirects, then scores any risky behaviour such as open redirects, token leakage, SSRF, or HTTPS downgrades.

## Features
- Severity scoring for findings (low/medium/high)
- Plugin system with a built-in final URL SSRF detector
- Configurable HTTP client with custom headers, cookies, and retry logic
- HTML report with redirect chain visualisation
- Redirect loop and excessive chain detection
- Landing page phishing heuristics
- Output modes: default, `--silent`, `--summary`, and `--only-risky`
- Colourised terminal output aware of hop types
- Rate-limited parallel scanning (default 10 threads)
- JSONL output format for downstream processing

## Quick start
Scan a single URL:
```bash
go run ./cmd/redirecthunter -u https://example.com
```

Fuzz a parameter and write JSONL and HTML reports:
```bash
go run ./cmd/redirecthunter \
  -u https://host/redirect?to=FUZZ \
  -w words.txt -t 20 -rl 5 \
  -o out.jsonl -html report.html
```
Advanced Fuzz parameter
```bash
go run ./cmd/redirecthunter -u 'https://host/redirect-to?url=FUZZ' \
  -w words.txt -t 20 -rl 5 -timeout 20s -retries 3 -max-chain 15 \
  -js-scan -H 'User-Agent: RedirectHunter/1.0' -H 'X-Demo: value' \
  -cookie 'session=abc123' -insecure -summary -plugins final-ssrf \
  -o out.jsonl -html report.html
```


## Flags
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-u` | Single URL (supports `FUZZ` placeholder) |
| `-w` | Wordlist when `-u` contains `FUZZ`; stdin if omitted |
| `-t` | Threads (default 10) |
| `-rl` | Global rate limit req/sec (0 = unlimited) |
| `-timeout` | Per-target timeout (default 8s) |
| `-retries` | Retry count for transient errors (default 1) |
| `-max-chain` | Max hops including meta/JS (default 15) |
| `-js-scan` | Enable HTML/JS redirect detection (default true) |
| `-o` | JSONL output file |
| `-html` | HTML report output file |
| `-H` | Extra HTTP header (repeatable) |
| `-cookie` | Cookie header |
| `-proxy` | HTTP(S) proxy URL |
| `-insecure` | Skip TLS verification |
| `-silent` | Suppress detailed chain output |
| `-summary` | Print one-line summary per target |
| `-only-risky` | Output only results with findings |
| `-plugins` | Comma-separated plugins to enable (default `final-ssrf`) |

## JSONL schema
Each line in the output represents a `Result` object:
```json
{
  "target": "https://example.com",
  "chain": [
    {"index":0,"url":"https://example.com","status":302,"via":"http-location","time_ms":12},
    {"index":1,"url":"https://other","status":200,"via":"http-location","time_ms":20,"final":true}
  ],
  "findings": [
    {"type":"HTTPS_DOWNGRADE","at_hop":1,"severity":"medium","detail":"https://a -> http://b"}
  ],
  "started_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "duration_ms": 42
}
```

## Development
```bash
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run ./...
go test ./...
```
